- Tweaks:
  - Controls: Added sensitivity sliders for the gamepad.
  - Graphics: Added texture quality preset (Low, Medium, High, Ultra).
  - Graphics: Added shadow quality preset (Low, Medium, High, Ultra).
  - Graphics: Added water shadow filter setting (Low, Medium, High).
  - Graphics: Added volumetric lighting quality setting (Low, Medium, High).
  - Graphics: Added overall graphics quality preset (Low, Medium, High, Ultra).
- Profiles:
  - Fixed a bug where creating and/or deleting profiles wouldn't save the changes. Therefore, after deleting a profile, it would still appear after restarting the tool.
- Home page:
  - Added web links.
  - "What's new" is now accessible through a button click.
- App Settings:
  - Removed "Hide What's new" option.
- Gallery:
  - Should search through the PTS screenshot folder for images and display them now.
- Translations:
  - Changed the font for titles in Japanese translation to Roboto Condensed.
  - Fixed a bug that would crash the tool if a translated resource (\*.rtf, \*.html) couldn't be accessed. (Either because the file is locked or access is denied)
- Windows 7 and 8.1:
  - The Info tab in Tweaks doesn't display the embedded webbrowser anymore. Instead, there will be a button to open the info document in the user's preferred browser.  
    (This is because I couldn't get the embedded webbrowser to work on older Windows versions. Windows 10 and 11 aren't affected)

### What's new in v1.11.2?

This is another small update to address some bugs.

**Changelog:**
<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

- App Settings:
  - Added a link to the app settings that opens the profile editing screen.
  - Added an option to disable automatic *.ini backups to the app settings.
  - Added an option to disable notifications (popups) to the app settings.
- Mod Manager:
  - Dragging and dropping mods (archives or folders) into the list installs them at the correct position (where the cursor is) instead of at the end of the list now.
  - Improved the comparison of versions in the mod manager.  
    This should fix the issue where the mod manager displays available updates even if the latest/newer version is installed.
  - Fixed a bug that would crash the mod manager when updating mod information using the NexusMods API.
  - Added another warning to the mod manager's side panel, if no (valid) files are found for packing.
  - Improved packing of bundled archives: junk files are now ignored. Should reduce errors.
- General:
  - Fixed a bug where invalid characters in (user-defined) paths were crashing the tool. They get sanitized now.

### Whatâ€™s new in v1.11.0? - The "fresh coat of paint" update

> **If you do not like the changes, you can download v1.10 from NexusMods or GitHub.**

Hello everyone,

this update is a rather large one - at least in terms of UI changes.  
I decided to rearrange everything and add a sidebar for navigation.

I tested almost every tweak and changed/removed old tweaks as well as adding a few new ones.  
The mod manager has two new options. Also, I fixed some smaller bugs.
Just explore a little, if you like to.

As always, you can read the changelog below.


Happy hunting,

~ datasnake
